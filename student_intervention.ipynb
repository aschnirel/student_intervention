Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "  <p> The pros of K-Nearest Neighbors are that it usually has high accuracy, is insensitive to outliers, and can be used with no assumptions about data. Those are huge!

For these reasons, I wanted to include KNN in my study, to use as a baseline and to have that baseline be easy to interpret. However, since many of the features are turned into binary data, their weight (due to scaling) is not as high as other features that are larger such as age. Still, KNN is a common baseline. </p> \n",

    "    <p>A classic machine learning problem is the classification of email as spam or not spam. In the article below, they used AdaBoost, with decision stumps as its base learner to determine spam or not spam. Researchers in 1999 used C4.5 decision trees as weak learners and reported high accuracy but slow execution time and they ended up recommendeding SVM instead. In 2001, researchers used decision stumps instead; with a single node and found the algorithm ran faster. In this article, candidate stumps are simply the presence or absence of a word in an email, which does scale very well with many key words. This article suggests that the AdaBoost algorithm, using decision stumps, is inferior in terms of both accuracy and speed to the Naive Bayes algorithm for this problem. With f = 3 and T = 3 on the ``tiny” data set, AdaBoost obtained only 86.7 percent accuracy, compared\n",

If the model fails at some point, you can determine at which weak learner it failed. This means you can manually tune the models to improve performance. Since with Machine Learning, overfitting is a common problem, Adaboost allows you to fine tune in addition to the \"boosting\" to avoid overfitting. However, Adaboost is fairly resistant to overfitting anyway. The default classifier, which will be used to start, is the Decision Tree Classifier. Decision Trees are a great place to start, because they are another algorithm that is easy to understand, by the lay person, with simple examples.

    "**Answer: **  I recommend using the the Adaboost Classifier. While the Support Vector Classifier has slightly higher F1 scores for the testing data, Support Vector algorithms are considered not that practical in the real world unless the data is particularly non-overlapping. In other words, we would have to have very distinct groups in order for Support Vector algorithms to be reliable. Adaboost is a useful algorithm since it can easily be tuned in many ways to avoid common problems such as overfitting and to improve accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that the Adaboost training time is about 100 times longer. While the F1 scores are so close, you could use this training time to break the tie. However, I believe that Adaboost has much more potential to improve the F1 score with tuning. Additionally, the Adaboost's training time seems to be fairly consistent across different training set sizes, whereas the Support Vector Classifier's training times double with each additional 100 data points added. This trent could continue on larger, real datasets. \n",

    "Since the goal is to identify students who might need early intervention before they fail to graduate, the Adaboost algorithm will use a collection of models to predict whether the students are in the \"yes\" or \"no\" category for neededing intervention. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method of classification called Adaboost can build a model by putting together several less effective models and averaging their results to make a better prediction. We wouldn't want to use one of the models by themselves because they do not perform well enough. But it has been shown that Adaboost can improve the performance by putting these \"weak learners,\" as they are called, together into one averaged model. The model can be improved upon with a set of data reserved for \"training\" the model. The first version of the Adaboost model is run and any of the models within Adaboost that predict incorrectly are weighted lower and any models that predict correctly are weighted higher in the final average. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do a \"tuning\" phase which also helps you decide which models to use to put together.  I will compare the Decision Tree Classifier, which is usually used with Adaboost, as well  Support Vector Classifier since it did pretty well in the preliminary testing. Using one of these models at a time, they will be tested across different numbers of models. This will help me choose the best parameters for the collection of models to be used. "
